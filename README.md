A climate action collective exploring alternative futures for the dance music community.

"Music and dance floors provide us with euphoric spaces to be free and create. How can we continue to enjoy them without causing irreparable damage to our planet?"

## RA Top 1000

This project was done in an attempt to bring further awareness to the environmental detriment that our scene creates. The complete list of artists ulitmately used totals at 987. Artists were omitted from this scrape for the following reasons:
1. The artist tours largely as a band, with a crew and usually by bus.
1. The artist has passed away.
1. The artist did not tour at all in 2019.
1. The artist's hometown was not visible on both RA and SoundCloud.
1. The artist was independently verified that they do not fly.

*Note:* Artists who do not tour as a band but include more than one person were counted as many times as people are in the act.


### Assumptions
We have made a set of assumptions in order to make a reasonable calculation with the public data available. They are as follows:
1. The the city in which an artist is based is taken first from soundcloud, then from RA, if both sources did not provide a city, then the artist was omitted.
1. The artist will fly in and out of the international airport in or closest to that artists home town.
1. The artist will fly in and out of the international airport closest to the address of the venue of that specific gig.
1. If an artist has more than one gig within two days of eachother, we assume the artist will fly from one gig to the next.
1. If an artist has more than one gig on the same foreign continent, that is _not_ the continent on which they are based within two weeks, we assume the artist will fly from one gig to the next.
1. If an artist travels to Austrailia from continental Europe or the Americas and there is no direct flight, we assume they layover in Dubai. 
1. For all other gigs, the artist will return "home" in between.
1. All artists travel in commercial economy class.
1. All events listed on RA for that artist happened and were attended by the artist.

*Note*: If a venue or flight route could not be found for a gig, the event was left out.
